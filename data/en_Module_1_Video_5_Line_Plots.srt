In this video, things will start getting more exciting. We will generate our first

1
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,540
visualization tool: the line plot. So what is a line plot? As its name suggests, it

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,010
is a plot in the form of a series of data points connected by straight line

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,900
segments. It is one of the most basic type of chart and is common in many

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,490
fields not just data science. The more important question is when to use line

5
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,829
plots. The best use case for a line plot is when you have a continuous dataset

6
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,539
and you're interested in visualizing the data over a period of time. As an

7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,190
example, say we're interested in the trend of immigrants from Haiti to Canada.

8
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,199
We can generate a line plot and the resulting figure will depict the trend

9
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:55,249
of Haitian immigrants to Canada from 1980 to 2013. Based on this line plot, we

10
00:00:55,249 --> 00:01:00,589
can then research for justifications of obvious anomalies or changes. So in this

11
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:06,200
example, we see that there is a spike of immigration from Haiti to Canada in 2010.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,049
A quick Google search for major events in Haiti in 2010 would return the tragic

13
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:16,759
earthquake that took place in 2010, and therefore this influx of immigration to

14
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,130
Canada was mainly due to that tragic earthquake. Okay now how can we generate

15
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,170
this line plot? Before we go over the code to do that, let's do a quick recap

16
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,780
of our dataset. Each row represents a country and contains metadata about the

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,679
country such as where it is located geographically, and whether it is

18
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:42,259
developing or developed. Each row also contains numerical figures of annual

19
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:48,039
immigration from that country to Canada from 1980 to 2013.

20
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:53,179
Now let's process the dataframe so that the country name becomes the index of

21
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:59,090
each row. This should make querying specific countries easier. Also let's add

22
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,009
an extra column which represents the cumulative sum of annual immigration from

23
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:12,200
each country from 1980 to 2013. So for Afghanistan, it is 58,639,

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,570
total, and for Albania it is 15,699,

25
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:26,750
and so on. And let's name our dataframe df_canada. So now

26
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,820
that we know how our data is stored in the dataframe, df_canada,

27
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,040
let's generate the line plot corresponding to immigration from Haiti.

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:44,780
First, we import Matplotlib as mpl and its scripting interface as plt. Then,

29
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,980
we call the plot function on the row corresponding to Haiti and we set kind

30
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,980
equals line to generate a line plot. Note that we used years which is a list

31
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,070
containing string format of years from 1980 to 2013 in order to exclude the

32
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,080
column of total immigration that we added. Then to complete the figure, we

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,990
give it a title and we label its axes. Finally we call the show function to

34
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,400
display the figure. Note that this is the code to generate the line plot using the

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,720
magic function % matplotlib with the inline backend. And there you have it: a

36
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,330
line plot that depicts immigration from Haiti to Canada from 1980 to 2013.

37
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,550
In the lab session, we explore line plots in more details so make sure to

38
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,530
complete this module's lab session. This concludes our video on line plots. I'll

39
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,180
see you in the next video.
