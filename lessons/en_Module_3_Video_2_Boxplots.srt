In this video, we will learn about another visualization tool: the box plot,

1
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:14,530
and we will learn how to create a using Matplotlib. So what is a box plot? A box

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,460
plot is a way of statistically representing the distribution of given

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,410
data through five main dimensions. The first dimension is minimum, which is the

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,900
smallest number in the sorted data. The second dimension is first quartile, which

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,270
is the point 25% of the way through the sorted data. In other words, a

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,670
quarter of the datapoints are less than this value. The third dimension is median,

7
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,710
which is the median of the sorted data. The fourth dimension is third quartile,

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,960
which is the point 75% of the way through the sorted data. In other words,

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,330
three-quarters of the data points are less than this value. And the final

10
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,580
dimension is maximum, which is the highest number in the sorted data. Now

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,860
let's see how we can create a box plot with Matplotlib. Before we go over the

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,590
code to do that, let's do a quick recap of our dataset. Recall that each row

13
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,230
represents a country and contains metadata about the country such as where

14
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,630
it is located geographically and whether it is developing or developed. Each row

15
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,370
also contains numerical figures of annual immigration from that country to

16
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,830
Canada from 1980 to 2013.

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,840
Now let's process the dataframe so that the country name becomes the index of

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,610
each row. This should make retrieving rows pertaining to specific countries a

19
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,250
lot easier. Also let's add an extra column which represents the cumulative

20
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,820
sum of annual immigration from each country from 1980 to 2013. So for

21
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:02,850
Afghanistan for example, it is 58,639, total, and for Albania, it is

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:13,510
15,699 and so on. And let's name our data frame df_canada. So now

23
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,320
that we know how our data is stored in the dataframe, df_canada,

24
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,270
say we're interested in creating a box plot to visualize

25
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,400
immigration from Japan to Canada. As with the other tools that we learned so far,

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:35,950
we start by importing Matplotlib as mpl and the pyplot interface as plt. Then we

27
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,480
create a new dataframe of the data pertaining to Japan and we're excluding

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
the column total using the years variable. Then we transpose the resulting

29
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,670
dataframe to make it in the correct format to create the box plot. Let's name

30
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,790
this new dataframe df_japan. Following that we call the plot function

31
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:05,290
on df_japan and we set kind equals box to generate a box plot. Then

32
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,050
to complete the figure we give it a title and we label the vertical axis.

33
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,670
Finally we call the show function to display the figure. And there you have it.

34
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,590
A box plot that provides a pleasing distribution of Japanese immigration to

35
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:27,640
Canada from 1980 to 2013. In the lab session, we explore box plots in more

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,769
details and learn how to create multiple box plots as well as horizontal box

37
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,230
plots, so make sure to complete this module's lab session. And with this we

38
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,980
conclude our video on box plots. I'll see you in the next video.
