In this video, we will learn about what some consider an advanced visualization

1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:13,940
tool, namely the waffle chart. So what is a waffle chart? A waffle chart is a great

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,699
way to visualize data in relation to a whole or to highlight progress against a

3
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:25,369
given threshold. For example, say immigration from Scandinavia to Canada

4
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:31,519
is comprised only of immigration from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and we're

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,750
interested in visualizing the contribution of each of these countries

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,780
to the Scandinavian immigration to Canada. The main idea here is for a given

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,150
waffle chart whose desired height and width are defined, the contribution of

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,070
each country is transformed into a number of tiles that is proportional to

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,320
the country's contribution to the total, so that more the contribution the more

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,260
the tiles, resulting in what resembles a waffle when combined. Hence the name

11
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,260
waffle chart. Unfortunately Matplotlib does not have a built-in function to

12
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,060
create waffle charts. Therefore, in the lab session, I'll walk you through the

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,220
process of creating your own Python function to create a waffle chart, so

14
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,630
it's really important that you complete this module's lab session. And with this,

15
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,159
we conclude our video on waffle charts. I'll see you in the next video.
