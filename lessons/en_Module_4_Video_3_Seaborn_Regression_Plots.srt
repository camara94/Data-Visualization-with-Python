In this video, we will learn about a new visualization library in Python, which is

1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,669
Seaborn. Although Seaborn is another data

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:15,809
visualization library, it is actually based on Matplotlib.

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,120
It was built primarily to provide a high-level interface for drawing

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,350
attractive statistical graphics, such as regression plots, box plots, and so on.

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,279
Seaborn makes creating plots very efficient. Therefore with Seaborn you

6
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,070
can generate plots with code that is 5 times less than with Matplotlib. Let's

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,149
see how we can use Seaborn to create a statistical graphic. Let's look into

8
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,449
regression plots. Let's say we have a dataframe called df_total of

9
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:55,979
total immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 with the year in one column and the

10
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,839
corresponding total immigration in another column, and say we're interested

11
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:05,850
in creating a scatter plot along with a regression line to highlight any trends

12
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,659
in the data. With Seaborn, you can do all this with literally one line of code. The

13
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,590
way to do this, we first import Seaborn and let's import it as sns. Then, we call

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,719
the Seaborn regplot function. We basically tell it to use the dataframe

15
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,509
df_total and to plot the column year on the horizontal axis and

16
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,030
the column total on the vertical axis. And the output of this one line of code

17
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,149
is a scatter plot with a regression line and not just that, but also 95%

18
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:47,429
confidence interval. Isn't that really amazing? Seaborn's regplot function

19
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:52,770
also accepts additional parameters for any personal customization. So you can

20
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,149
change the color for example using the color parameter. Let's go ahead and

21
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,240
change the color to green. Also, you can change the marker shape as well using

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,009
the marker parameter. Let's go ahead and change the shape of our markers to a +

23
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,170
marker  instead of the default circular marker. In the lab session, we

24
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,980
explore regression plots with Seaborn in more details, so

25
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,540
make sure to complete this module's lab session. And with this we conclude our

26
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,440
short introduction to Seaborn and regression plots. I'll see you in the

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,950
next video.
