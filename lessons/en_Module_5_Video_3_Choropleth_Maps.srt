In this video, we will learn how to create a special type of map called

1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,460
choropleth map with Folium. I&#39;m sure that most of you have seen maps similar to

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,070
this one and this one. These are what we call choropleth maps. So what is a

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,920
choropleth map? A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,090
or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,270
being displayed on the map, such as population density or per capita income.

6
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,340
The higher the measurement the darker the color. The map to the left is a

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,910
choropleth map of the world showing infant mortality rate per 1000 births.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,710
The darker the color the higher the infant mortality rate. According to the

9
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,629
map, African countries have very high infant mortality rates with some of them

10
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,059
reporting a rate that is higher than 160 per 1000 births.

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,320
Similarly, the map to the right is a choropleth map of the US showing

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,750
population per square mile by state. Again the darker the color the higher

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,670
the population. According to the map, states in the eastern part of the US

14
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,920
tend to be more populous than states in the western part, with California being

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,830
an exception. In order to create a choropleth map of a region of interest,

16
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,750
Folium requires a Geo JSON file that includes geospatial data of the region.

17
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,689
For a choropleth map of the world, we would need a Geo JSON file that lists

18
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,060
each country along with any geospatial data to define its borders and

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,369
boundaries. Here is an example of what the Geo JSON file would include about

20
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:54,810
each country. The example here pertains to the country Brunei. As you can see, the

21
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:02,040
file includes the country&#39;s name, it&#39;s ID, geometry shape, and the coordinates that

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,780
define the country&#39;s borders and boundaries. So let&#39;s see how we can

23
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,129
create a choropleth map of the world like this one showing immigration to

24
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,800
Canada. Before we go over the code to do that, let&#39;s do a

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,430
quick recap of our dataset. Recall that each row represents a country and

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,930
contains metadata about the country such as where it is located geographically

27
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,760
and whether it is developing or developed. Each row also contains

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,640
numerical figures of annual immigration from that country to Canada from 1980 to

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,580
2013. Now let&#39;s process the data and let&#39;s add

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,990
an extra column which represents the cumulative sum of annual immigration from

31
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:55,660
each country from 1980 to 2013. So for Afghanistan for example,

32
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:03,760
it is 58,639, total, and for Albania it is 15,699,

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,660
and so on. And let&#39;s name our dataframe df_canada.

34
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,400
So now that we know how our data is stored in the dataframe,

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,320
df_canada, let&#39;s see how we can generate a choropleth map of the

36
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,660
world showing immigration to Canada. We should be experts now in creating world

37
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,459
maps with Folium so let&#39;s go ahead and create a world map but this time let&#39;s

38
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,650
use the mapbox bright tiles set. The result is a nice world map displaying

39
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,290
the name of every country. Now to convert this map into a choropleth map, we first

40
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,989
define a variable that points to our Geo JSON file. Then we apply the choropleth

41
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,510
function to our world map and we tell it to use the columns &quot;Country&quot; and &quot;Total&quot; in

42
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,360
our df_canada dataframe, and to use the country names to look up the

43
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,450
geospatial information about each country in the Geo JSON file. And there

44
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,130
you have it. A choropleth map of Canada showing the intensity of immigration

45
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,350
from different countries worldwide. In the lab session, we explore choropleth

46
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,380
maps in more details, so please make sure to complete this module&#39;s lab session. And

47
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,230
with this, we conclude our video on choropleth maps.
