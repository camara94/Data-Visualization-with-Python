In this video, we will learn about an additional visualization tool: the

1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,339
scatter plot, and we will learn how to create it using Matplotlib. So what is a

2
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:17,490
scatter plot? A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays values pertaining to

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,590
typically two variables against each other. Usually it is a dependent variable

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,990
to be plotted against an independent variable in order to determine if any

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,359
correlation between the two variables exists. For example, here is a scatter

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,969
plot of income versus education and by looking at the plotted data one can

7
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,769
conclude that an individual with more years of education is likely to earn a

8
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:48,480
higher income than an individual with fewer years of education. So how can we

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,489
create a scatterplot with Matplotlib? Before we go over the code to do that,

10
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,609
let's do a quick recap of our dataset. Recall that each row represents a

11
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,820
country and contains metadata about the country such as where it is located

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,170
geographically and whether it is developing or developed. Each row also

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,909
contains numerical figures of annual immigration from that country to Canada

14
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,890
from 1980 to 2013.

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,899
Now let's process the dataframe so that the country name becomes the index of

16
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:29,670
each row. This should make retrieving rows pertaining to specific countries a

17
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,310
lot easier. Also let's add an extra column which represents the cumulative

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,909
sum of annual immigration from each country from 1980 to 2013. So for

19
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:49,939
Afghanistan for example, it is 58,639, total, and for Albania it is

20
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:59,429
15,699 and so on. And let's name our dataframe df_canada. So now

21
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,740
that we know how our data is stored in the dataframe, df_canada, say

22
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,690
were interested in plotting a scatter plot of the total annual immigration to

23
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,040
Canada from 1980 to 2013. To be able to do that,

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,810
we first need to create a new dataframe that shows each year and the

25
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,890
corresponding total number of immigration from all the countries worldwide as

26
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,610
shown here. Let's name this new dataframe, df_total. In the lab

27
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,989
session, we will walk together through the process of creating df_total

28
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,730
from df_canada, so make sure to complete this module's lab

29
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,060
session. Then we proceed as usual. We import Matplotlib as mpl and its

30
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,879
scripting layer, the pyplot interface, as plt. Then we call the plot function on

31
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,870
the data frame df_total and we set kind equals scatter to generate a

32
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,310
scatter plot. Now unlike the other data visualization

33
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,590
tools were only passing the kind parameter was enough to generate the

34
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,409
plot, with scatter plots we also need to pass the variable to be plotted on the

35
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,940
horizontal axis as the x-parameter and the variable to be plotted on the

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,750
vertical axis as the y-parameter. In this case, we're passing column year as the

37
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,319
x-parameter and column total as the y-parameter. Then to complete the figure we

38
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,199
give it a title and we label its axes. Finally, we call the show function to

39
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,560
display the figure. And there you have it. A scatter plot that shows total

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,400
immigration to Canada from countries all over the world from 1980 to 2013. The

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
scatter plot clearly depicts an overall rising trend of immigration with time. In

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,379
the lab session we explore scatter plots in more details and learn about a very

43
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,579
interesting variation of this scatter plot, a plot called the bubble plot, and

44
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,169
we learn how to create it using Matplotlib. So make sure to complete this

45
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,690
module's lab session. And with this, we conclude our video on scatter plots. I'll

46
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,220
see you in the next video.
