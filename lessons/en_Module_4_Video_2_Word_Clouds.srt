In this video, we will learn about another advanced visualization tool: the

1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,580
word cloud. So what is a word cloud? A word cloud is simply a depiction of the

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,699
importance of different words in the body of text. A word cloud works in a

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,490
simple way; the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data the

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,470
bigger and bolder it appears in the world cloud. So given some text data on

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,140
recruitment, for example, we generate a cloud of words like this. This cloud is

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,910
telling us that words such as recruitment, talent, candidates, and so on,

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,309
are the words that really stand out in these text documents. And assuming that

8
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,300
we didn't know anything about the content of these documents, a word cloud

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,989
can be very useful to assign a topic to some unknown textual data. Unfortunately,

10
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:59,550
just like waffle charts, Matplotlib does not have a built-in function to generate

11
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,640
word clouds. However, luckily a Python library for cloud word generation that

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,710
was created by Andreas Mueller is publicly available. So, in the lab session

13
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,630
we will learn how to use Mueller's word cloud generator and we will also create

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,909
interesting word clouds superimposed on different background images. So make sure

15
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,220
to complete this modules lab session. And with this, we conclude our video on word

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,170
clouds. I'll see you in the next video.
