In this video, we will learn about a very interesting data visualization library

1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,340
in Python which is Folium. Folium is a powerful data visualization library in

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,580
Python that was built primarily to help people visualize geospatial data. With

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,529
Folium, you can create a map of any location in the world as long as you

4
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,390
know its latitude and longitude values. You can also create a map and

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,540
superimpose markers as well as clusters of markers on top of the map for cool

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,250
and very interesting visualizations. You can also create maps of different styles

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,989
such as street level map, stamen map and, a couple others which we will look

8
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,969
into in just a moment. Creating a world map with Folium is pretty

9
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,719
straightforward. You simply call the map function and that is all. What is really

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,460
interesting about the maps created by Folium is that they are interactive, so

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,280
you can zoom in and out after the map is rendered, which is a super useful feature.

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,260
The default map style is the open street map, which shows a street view of an area

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,700
when you&#39;re zoomed in and shows the borders of the world countries when

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,460
you&#39;re zoomed all the way out. Now let&#39;s create a world map centred around

15
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,710
Canada. To do that, we pass in the latitude and the longitude values of

16
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,560
Canada using the location parameter and with Folium you can set the initial zoom

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,200
level using the zoom start parameter. Now I say initial because you can easily

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,479
change the zoom level after the map is rendered by zooming in or zooming out.

19
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,920
You can play with this parameter to figure out what the initial zoom level

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,840
looks like for different values. Now, let&#39;s set the zoom level for our map of

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,340
Canada to 4. And there you go. Here is a world map centred around Canada.

22
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,479
Another amazing feature of Folium is that you can create different map styles

23
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,660
using the tiles parameter. Let&#39;s create a stamen toner map of Canada. This

24
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,380
style is great for visualizing and exploring river meanders

25
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:21,240
and coastal zones. Another style is stamen terrain. Let&#39;s create a map of

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,730
Canada in stamen terrain. This style is great for visualizing hill shading and

27
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,240
natural vegetation colors. And with this we conclude our introduction to Folium.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,040
I&#39;ll see you in the next video.
