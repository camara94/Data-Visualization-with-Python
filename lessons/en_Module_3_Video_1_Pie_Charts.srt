00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,830
In this video, we will learn about another visualization tool: the pie chart,

1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,599
and we will learn how to create it using Matplotlib.

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,700
So what is a pie chart? A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic divided

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,400
into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. For example, here is a pie

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,440
chart of the Canadian federal election back in 2015 were the Liberals in red

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,780
won more than 50% of the seats in the House of Commons. That is why the red

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,550
color occupies more than half of the circle. So how do we create a pie chart

7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,940
with Matplotlib? Before we go over the code to do that, let's do a quick recap

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,789
of our dataset. Recall that each row represents a country and contains

9
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:53,920
metadata about the country such as where it is located geographically and whether

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,649
it is developing or developed. Each row also contains numerical figures of

11
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:06,360
annual immigration from that country to Canada from 1980 to 2013.

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,370
Now let's process the dataframe so that the country name becomes the index of

13
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,140
each row. This should make retrieving rows pertaining to specific countries a

14
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,660
lot easier. Also let's add an extra column which represents the cumulative

15
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,380
sum of annual immigration from each country from 1980 to 2013. So for

16
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:37,410
Afghanistan for example, it is 58,639, total, and for Albania, it is

17
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:48,940
15,699 and so on. And let's name our dataframe df_canada. So now

18
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,460
that we know how our data is stored in the dataframe df_canada, say

19
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,540
we're interested in visualizing a breakdown of immigration to Canada

20
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,590
continent wise. The first step is to group our data by

21
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,289
continent using the continent column and we use pandas for this. We call the

22
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:13,359
pandas groupby function on df_canada and we sum the number

23
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,670
of immigrants from the countries that belong to the

24
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,829
same continent. Here is the resulting dataframe, and let's name it

25
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:26,049
df_continents. The resulting dataframe has six rows, each

26
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:33,090
representing a continent and 35 columns representing the years from 1980 to 2013

27
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,950
plus the cumulative sum of immigration for each continent. And now we're ready

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,700
to start creating our pie chart. We start with the usual, importing Matplotlib as

29
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,540
mpl and its scripting layer the pyplot interface as plt. Then we call the

30
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,940
plot function on column total of the dataframe df_continents and

31
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,450
we set kind equals pie to generate a pie chart. Then to complete the figure we

32
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,709
give it a title. Finally we call the show function to

33
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:14,109
display the figure. And there you have it. A pie chart that depicts each continent's

34
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:20,949
proportion of immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013. In the lab session, we will

35
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,480
go through the process of creating a very professional-looking and

36
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,989
aesthetically pleasing pie chart and transform the pie chart that we just

37
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,970
created into one that looks like this. So make sure to complete this module's lab

38
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,940
session. One last comment on pie charts. There are some very vocal opponents to

39
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,949
the use of pie charts under any circumstances. Most argue that pie charts

40
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:50,709
fail to accurately display data with any consistency. Bar charts are much

41
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,970
better when it comes to representing the data in a consistent way and getting the

42
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,079
message across. If you're interested in learning more about the arguments

43
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,519
against pie charts, here is a link to a very interesting article that discusses

44
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,290
very clearly the flaws of pie charts. You can also find the link under the video.

45
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,870
And with this we conclude our video on pie charts. I'll see you in the next

46
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,169
video.
