Hello everyone and welcome to the first module of the data visualization with

1
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,219
Python course. In this video, we're gonna introduce data visualization and go over

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,830
an example of transforming a given visual into one which is more effective

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:23,160
attractive and impactive. So let's get started. Now one might ask why would I

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,289
need to learn how to visualize data. Well data visualization is a way to show a

5
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,719
complex data in a form that is graphical and easy to understand. This can be

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,309
especially useful when one is trying to explore the data and getting acquainted

7
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,309
with it. Also since a picture is worth a thousand words, then plots and graphs can

8
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,079
be very effective in conveying a clear description of the data especially when

9
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,309
disclosing findings to an audience or sharing the data with other peer data

10
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,800
scientists. Also, they can be very valuable when it comes to supporting any

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,780
recommendations you make to clients managers or other decision-makers in

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,290
your field. Darkhorse Analytics is a company that spun out of a research lab

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,480
at the University of Alberta in 2008 and has done fascinating work on data

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,490
visualization. Darkhorse Analytics specializes in quantitative consulting

15
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,490
in several areas including data visualization and geo spatial analysis.

16
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,920
Their approach when creating a visual revolves around three key points: less is

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,550
more effective, it is more attractive, and it is more impactive. In other words, any

18
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,770
feature or design you incorporate in your plot to make it more attractive or

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,270
pleasing should support the message that the plot is meant to get across and not

20
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,240
distract from it. Let's take a look at an example. So here is a pie chart of what

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,950
looks like people's preferences when it comes to different types of pig meat. The

22
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,750
charts message is almost half of the people surveyed preferred bacon over the

23
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,399
other types of pig meat. But I'm sure that almost all of you agree that there

24
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,960
is a lot going on in this pie chart and we're not even sure it features such as

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,530
the blue background or 3d orientation are meant to convey

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,989
anything. In fact, these additional unnecessary features distract from the

27
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,060
main message and can be confusing to the audience. So let's apply Darkhorse

28
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,670
Analytics approach to transform this into a visual that's more effective,

29
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,410
attractive, and impactive. As I mentioned earlier, the message here is that people

30
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,569
are most likely to choose bacon over other types of pig meat, so let's get rid

31
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,920
of everything that can be distracting from this core message. The first thing

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,310
is let's get rid of the blue background and the gray background. Let's also get

33
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:00,209
rid of borders as they do not convey any extra information. Also let's drop the

34
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:06,060
redundant legend since the pie chart is already color coded. 3D isn't adding any

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,680
extra information so let's say bye to it. Text bolding is also unnecessary and

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,180
let's get rid of the different colors and the wedges. Wow! What just happened?

37
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,410
Well let's thicken the lines to make them more meaningful. Now this looks a

38
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:32,359
little familiar. Yes! This is a bar graph after all, one with horizontal bars. And

39
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:37,530
finally, let's emphasize bacon so that it stands out among the other types of pig

40
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,980
meat. Now let's juxtapose the pie chart and the bar graph and compare which is

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,630
better and easy to understand. I hope that we unanimously agree that the bar

42
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,819
graph is the better of the two. It is simple, cleaner, less distracting, and much

43
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,370
easier to read. In fact, pie charts have recently come under fire from data

44
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,750
visualization experts who argue that they are relevant only in the rarest of

45
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,579
circumstances. Bar graphs and charts on the other hand are argued to be far

46
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,930
superior ways to quickly get a message across. But don't worry about this for

47
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,739
now, we will come back to this point when we learn how to create pie charts and

48
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,690
bar graphs with Matplotlib. For more similar and interesting

49
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,099
examples, check out Darkhorse Analytics website. They have a couple more examples

50
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,270
on how to clean bar graphs and maps of geospatial data. All these examples

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:38,000
reinforce the concept of less is more effective, attractive, and impactive.
