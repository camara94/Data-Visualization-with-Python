In this video, we will continue working with the Folium library and learn how

1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,120
to superimpose markers on top of a map for interesting visualizations. In the

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,760
previous video, we learned how to create a world map centred around Canada, so

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,460
let&#39;s create this map again and name it canada_map this time. Ontario

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,449
is a Canadian province and contains about 40 percent of the Canadian

5
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,969
population. It is considered Canada&#39;s most populous province. Let&#39;s see how we

6
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,360
can add a circular mark to the centre of Ontario. To do that, we need to create

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,010
what is called a feature group. Let&#39;s go ahead and create a feature group named

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,620
ontario. Now when a feature group is created, it is empty and that means

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,239
what&#39;s next is to start creating what is called children and adding them to the

10
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,359
feature group. So let&#39;s create a child in the form of a red circular mark located

11
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,460
at the centre of the Ontario province. We specify the location of the child by

12
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,530
passing in its latitude and longitude values. And once we&#39;re done adding

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,900
children to the feature group we add the featured group to the map. And there you

14
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,270
have it. A red circular mark superimposed on top of the map and added to the

15
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,909
centre of the province of Ontario. Now it would be nice if we could actually label

16
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,780
this marker in order to let other people know what it actually represents. To do

17
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,970
that, we simply use the marker function and the pop up parameter to pass in

18
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,189
whatever text we want to add to this marker. And there you go. Now our marker

19
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,740
displays Ontario when clicked on. In the lab session, we will look into a

20
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,990
real-world example and explore crime rate in San Francisco. We will create a

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,000
map of San Francisco and superimpose thousands of these markers on top of the

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,100
map. Not just that but I&#39;ll show you how you can also create clusters of markers

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,370
in order to make your map look less congested. This module&#39;s lab session is a

24
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,280
very interesting one so please make sure to complete it.

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,200
And with this, we conclude our video on adding markers to maps with Folium. I&#39;ll

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,700
see you in the next video.
