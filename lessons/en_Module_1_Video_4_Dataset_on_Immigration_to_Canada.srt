00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,990
In this video, we will learn more about the dataset that we will be using

1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,720
throughout the course. The population division of the United Nations compiled

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,970
immigration data pertaining to 45 countries. The data consist of the total

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,590
number of immigrants from all over the world to each of the 45 countries as

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:27,289
well as other metadata pertaining to the immigrants countries of origin. In this

5
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:32,419
course, we will focus on immigration to Canada and we will work primarily with

6
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:37,879
the data set involving immigration to the great white north Here is a snapshot

7
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,909
of the UN data on immigration to Canada in the form of an excel file. As you can

8
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:49,850
see, the first twenty rows contain textual data about the UN Department and other

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:56,659
irrelevant information. Row 21 contains the labels of the columns. Following that

10
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:02,569
each row represents a country and contains metadata about the country such

11
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:07,490
as what continent it resides in, what region it belongs to, and whether the

12
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,620
region is developing or developed. Each row also contains the total number of

13
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,370
immigrants from that country for the years 1980 all the way to 2013.

14
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:23,120
Throughout this course, we will be using pandas for any analysis of the data

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,760
before creating any visualizations. So in order to start creating different types

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,650
of plots of the data whether for exploratory analysis or for presentation,

17
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:40,310
we will need to import the data into a pandas dataframe. To do that, we will

18
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,440
need to import the pandas library as well as the xlrd library, which is

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,120
required to extract data from Excel spreadsheet files. Then we call the

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,800
pandas function read_excel to read the data into a pandas dataframe.

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,890
And let's name this dataframe df_can. Notice how we're skipping

22
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,640
the first twenty rows to read only the data  corresponding to each country. If you

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,019
want to confirm that you have imported your data correctly, in pandas, you can

24
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:17,680
always use the head function to display the first five rows of the dataframe. So,

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,799
if we call this function on our dataframe, df_can, here is the

26
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:28,870
output. As you can see, the output of the head function looks correct with the

27
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,129
columns having the correct labels and each row representing a country and

28
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:37,900
containing the total number of immigrants from that country. This

29
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,340
concludes our video on the immigration to Canada dataset. I will see you in the

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,879
next video.
